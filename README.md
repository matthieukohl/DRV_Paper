# DRV_Paper
# Provides the code to solve the tilted 2-layer model equations (Kohl and O'Gorman 2022, JAS submitted) for the most unstable mode with and without meridional PV gradients

# Tilted Model Folder: 
# main.m runs the code to calculate the example DRV mode in the tilted model without PV-gradients, and plot_DRV_example_split_up_down.m was used to plot the vertical velocity, PV/diabatic generation structure, and low level PV-tendencies for the example DRV figure. main_sigma_b_time_marching.m runs the code to calculate the growth rate, and scale of DRVs on a finite domain for a variety of r values. plot_Dispersion_DRV.m solves the analytical equations for the dispersion relation on an infinite domain and compares to the finite domain solutions. plot_DRV_comparison.m compares the vertical velocity profile for finite and infinite domain calculations.

# Tilted Model With Meridional Gradients Folder:
# main_qy_vs_r.m & main_q1y_vs_q2y_fixed_r.m run the code to calculate the growth rate and scale of unstable modes in the tilted model with meridional pv gradients. plot_periodic_wave_or_DRV_phase_diagram.m is used generate the phase diagram figure classifying whether the most unstable mode is a DRV vs. periodic wave.
